# arXiv - ShortScience extension

A Chrome extension for arXiv readers that will pop open associated explanations present on http://www.shortscience.org/ when present (otherwise will not change experience).

Contributions welcome. Displaying explanations inline, popping up a modal, etc. could make the experience better (the current solution is meant to be minimal wrt permissions), and selectors in querying shortscience could be cleaned up.

## Installation

Open chrome preferences, click "developer mode" in the top right, then "load unpacked extension". Navigate to this folder and confirm.
